# Regression-predicting-house-prices
I will be exploring the housing sale prices in King County, USA between the time period May 2014 - May 2015.

Firstly, I will go through a thorough data exploration to identify most important features and to explore the intercorrelation between features. After that I apply data normalization between varialbes and conduct feature engineering.
